<h1> Random Jokes Machine </h1>

<p> In this project I focused on building random jokes generator that takes JSON encoded data object from the external API, parses it and displays a random joke.</p>

<p> When page loads, user can see a joke. To see a new joke, user can click "New Joke" button. User can also share the joke on twitter.</p>

<p> Bootstrap is used for styling. </p>
